## RUN ###
* To run the application just type 'npm start' on your terminal
* (this config are in package.json)

### Functional ###
* When the user hits the 'Answer' button, we need to check if the answer is correctly an then sum 1 to the score if the user has no tips.
* When the user hits the 'I give up' button, the text field will shown the right name, but the score will not be incremented..
* When the user hits the 'Next', will sort another image to let the user guess who is it.

### Non-Functional  ###
* web app framework: AngularJS.
* Also, we use a presentation framework such as Material Design in Angular Material.
* Task automation (gulp) is a nice addition.
* Readme files.
